# Project Uppsala 

The GIS data herein is derived from either public documents produced by the Uppsala Kommune (Uppsala.se) or in the case of the number of Green Certified buildings, open access info produced by the Swedish Green Building Council (SCB.se). This is information is of public interest and will be used to test the eCitizenScience, eGov, and PeoplesEPA  tools.

This analyses which summarizes the actual areas implicated by the planning; areas which have been missing from the reports.
